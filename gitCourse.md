# Working With Git Notes

## git diff
using git diff without any ID's will compare the working directory to the staging area. 

## Instructor Notes - *git reset*
If you accidentally add a file to the staging area, you can remove it using git reset. For example, if you accidentally add lesson_2_reflections.txt, but donâ€™t want it to be committed yet, run git reset lesson_2_reflections.txt and the file will be removed from the staging area, but it will still be in your working directory.
